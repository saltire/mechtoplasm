# MECHTOPLASM

**Go ahead, mech my day!**

In the future, the world will be (even more of) a barren wasteland and the corporations will be all that's left. They will train hyper-intelligent animals to pilot mechs and have giant robot battles! Smash abandoned buildings, collect orbs of power, and be the first to beam back to your home planet.

Requires 2 players and Xbox controllers.
